# 3D-Movement
A 3D first person game with movement/physics mechanics.

### TODO:
- Create level
 
- Add weapons (basics done):
- so far added pistol and rifle. Maybe search for a better muzzle flash later. Now weapon switch. (done)

- Add enemies:
- NavMesh, different states - patrolling, attacking, idle. Enemy vision, shooting, vfx.


- create a main game idea and decide on the theme to prevent feature creep and artstyle inconsistencies. (so far its supposed to be a shooter with hookshot movement mechanics).
- create sound design
